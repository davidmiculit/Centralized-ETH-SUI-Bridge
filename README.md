# Centralized ETH-SUI Bridge
This project is all about bridging two different blockchains for transferring tokens using minting and burning methods.  It involves running two localchains and deploying smart contracts that implement a specific token, which is transferrable between the Ethereum wallet and Sui wallet using authentication via Metamask and Suiet.
